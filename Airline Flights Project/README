End-to-End Data Science Project Overview
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis:
Investigated each feature type and values.
Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:
Explored the relationships between features.
Data Cleaning:
Ensured data is properly cleaned for analysis.
Business Questions:
Formulated business questions that can be answered through data analysis and visualization.
2. Data Preparation for Regression Task
Missing Data Handling:
Dealt with missing data.
Outlier Treatment:
Addressed outliers if present.
Feature Engineering:
Engineered new features to enhance model performance.
Categorical Encoding:
Encoded categorical features using appropriate techniques.
Feature Scaling:
Conducted feature scaling if necessary.
3. Machine Learning Modeling
Regression Model Building:
Developed a regression model to predict airline flight prices.
4. Deployment
Model Deployment:
Deployed the regression model using Streamlit Cloud for easy access and interaction.
This project encompasses the entire data science pipeline, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning modeling and deployment, ensuring a comprehensive and structured approach to solving the problem at hand.
