Loan Project Classification Overview
1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on various features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis:
Investigated each feature type and values.
Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:
Explored the relationships between features.
Data Cleaning:
Ensured data is properly cleaned for analysis.
Business Questions:
Formulated business questions that can be answered through data analysis and visualization.
3. Data Preparation for Classification Task
Missing Data Handling:
Dealt with missing data.
Outlier Treatment:
Addressed outliers if present.
Feature Engineering:
Engineered new features to enhance model performance.
Categorical Encoding:
Encoded categorical features using appropriate techniques.
Feature Scaling:
Conducted feature scaling if necessary.
4. Machine Learning Modeling
Classification Model Building:
Developed a classification model to predict loan approval status.
5. Deployment
Model Deployment:
Deployed the classification model on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and interaction.
This project aims to streamline the loan approval process by leveraging machine learning to predict loan outcomes accurately, ultimately improving decision-making and efficiency in the lending domain.
